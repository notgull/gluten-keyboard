# gluten-keyboard

This simple crate contains the `Keys` enum, which provides a set of every key that could be reasonably found on a keyboard in 2021, as well as a function to convert the key press to a character (where applicable). This was largely created as I couldn't find any crates providing a similar enum without also being a part of a GUI monocrate.
